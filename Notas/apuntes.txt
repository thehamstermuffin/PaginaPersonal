<main>

<header>header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

<section>  vs <article>
Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgement call, but there are a couple simple tests you can use. Ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense? Similarly for text, would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?
<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content

<footer>
<nav>

<div>
<span>

<audio>

<figure> <figcaption>

<label> etiqueta texto debe coincidir con el id
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>

<fieldset><legend>

<time>
<time datetime>It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text.
First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.

--------------------CSS-------------------------

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users

justify-content:center;

------------------Grid--------------------------
display:grid;
grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 100px 2fr;
    Lets say you want a grid with 100 rows of the same height. It isn't very practical to insert 100 values individually. Fortunately, there's a better way - by using the repeat function to specify the number of times you want your column or row to be repeated, followed by a comma and the value you want to repeat.
     minmax. It's used to limit the size of items when the grid container changes size. To do this you need to specify the acceptable size range for
     The repeat function comes with an option called auto-fill. This allows you to automatically insert as many rows or columns of your desired size as possible depending on the size of the container.
     auto-fit
grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
grid-column-gap:10px;
grid-column:2/4; abarca de la columna 2 a la 4
align-self:end;
justify-items:
align items:

grid-template-areas:
"header header header"
  "advert content content"
  "footer footer footer";

una vez creadas las areas, se pueden acomodar de la siguiente manera
.item1 { grid-area: header; }

otra forma es:
grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;
item1 { grid-area: 1/1/2/4; }

----------------JavaScript-----------------
data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive

est Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase.

String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote.
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

-------------Arrays------------------
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

myarray.push([]) agrega al final
myarray.pop()  quita el ultimo elemento
myarray.shift() quita el primer elemento
myarray.unshift([]) agrega el primer elemento


splice(); quitar/cambiar elementos
slice();
indexOf();
//every(), forEach(), map() --> es mas versatil usar un for


objetos
hasOwnProperty()

for...in statement

--------------funciones----
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.

Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.


--------------ES6--------------------
A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.
Note the "use strict". This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.
However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]

To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.


Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

----------------REGULAR EXPRESSIONS---------------------
Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern
One way to test a regex is using the .test() method
